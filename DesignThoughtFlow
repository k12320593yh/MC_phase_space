Potential NP Operations that may be useful:

--np.transpose

The goal is to swap the desired axis to the first a fwe in order to slice them off once and for all. Suppose I have a order 5 tensor with five indices


--np.tensordot

This seems the key to realise tensor contractions. First apply metric tensors to achieve proper index cases, then do the tensor dot.

#With cuts applied, the integral value is now more steady;
