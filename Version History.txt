0.7
--various bug fixes.
--The rotation part is now carefully checked and should work as expected.

0.6
--can now handle gamma matrices.
--can now handle generaal Lorentz Object contracition
--pending trace calculation function. Symbolic or Analytic?


0.5
--two_three_phase_space_dot now takes s_sqrt as an argument, rather than sily momentum0 and momentum1.

0.4:
--l4v.zprapidity can now correctly reconise negative rapidity.


0.3:
--L4V.lorentz_transformation is modified so that user can choose between two modes: mode0 that changes the original 4 vector's components,
and mode1 that genertaes a new l4v object with the transformed components and same mass.
--L4V now has a new attribute dedicated to record its orginal four components. Initialised in __init__.
--Fixed some minor bugs


0.2:
--Fixed bugs in .lorentz_rot_toz() and .z_boost_to_rest_frame(). Now these features should work fine.

--Rewrote find_toz_rotation(vector). Now it depends on two new functions, making the whole package more modulised.

--Removed the .__index_case attribute. Just don't find this necessary anymore.

--Plan to imporve the MC integrator next week.

0.1:
First version.
